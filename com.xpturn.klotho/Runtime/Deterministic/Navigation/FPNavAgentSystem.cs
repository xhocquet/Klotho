            // WHAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES, measured. Read as written the loop below is a ladder that
            // skips leading crossings until one falls outside the ball. It does not behave like
            // one: counting which rung returns, over six open-field runs (cell 4/8/16, reach 2.5 to
            // 100), the FIRST rung returned exactly once per journey — the opening plan — the
            // second returned NEVER, and every other plan skipped twice and returned the third aim
            // below without a reach test. So this is not "skip what was already crossed"; it is a
            // fixed three-hop lookahead, and the two reach tests are true by construction after the
            // first plan.
            //
            // The reason is the second reference point. lastLegEndXZ reads nav.PathTarget, which is
            // written only on a successful plan (below) and therefore holds the crossing this leg
            // is walking TOWARD, not where the last one ended. The plan that follows a hand-off asks
            // for that same crossing or its neighbour, which is inside that ball by construction —
            // so rungs one and two always skip. That is load-bearing rather than a defect: removing
            // the term doubles the number of legs on the same journey (the travel time is
            // unchanged, so it is pure planning cost) and introduces leg targets reached on the
            // plan tick. It is also harmless where it is theoretically wrong — the value is
            // FPVector3.Zero before the first plan, and over seventeen runs on a field centred on
            // the world origin, walking both toward it and away, that zero decided a skip zero
            // times: the term is only consulted on a plan, and the first aim is always a node ahead
            // of the agent, so "aim within reach of the origin while the agent is not" did not
            // occur. Renaming the field would say what it is; changing it would cost the above.
            //
            // The third aim is returned without a test, which is where the ladder ends today.

            //       the production path pays nothing) — which is why the reason is derived here.
            //   (2) the next corridor triangle is refused by this mask. This is what separates a
            //       building from a real wall: against a real wall the corridor's next triangle is
            //       still enterable, so the agent keeps sliding, which is the behaviour that must
            //       survive.
